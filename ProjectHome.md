This is a fork of gpg-mailgate (http://code.google.com/p/gpg-mailgate/), which has not been maintained since 2010. I have changed the source to work with FreeBSD-9.2 Python-2.7 and GnuPG-2.0.22.
This fork uses TLS to communicate with the SMTP relay.
You can also add aliases to the gpg-mailgate config.
